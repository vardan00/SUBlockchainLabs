# Lab 4.3: Escrow Services


In this lab, you are given the initial state that a custom Blockchain network of several miners is hosted on an on-campus machine. The Blockchain machine also runs a daemon that periodically instructs some miner to conduct transactions with other miners.

The lab will feature programming exercises for implementing the
normal workflow of an escrow service (e.g., deposit and final payment) and the dispute
resolution (i.e., returning payment to the buyer).

Create 3 accounts and Mine few Ethers in to all the accounts. Refer Lab 3.1 for more details.

In this lab, you will create a contract for Escrow Service given the System Design for the contract and call the functions. Refer [[link](https://github.com/BlockchainLabSU/SUBlockchainLabs.internal/tree/master/lab4.1)] to know more about how to deploy simple contract and call its functions.


## Escrow Service and Contract understanding

Escrow is a framework for a buyer to be confident that he will not release funds to the seller unless he is happy with the product. Third party/trusted party will be involved usually to take care of this and they will charge a fee for this.

An escrow protocol is a three-party protocol among a buyer, a seller and an explicit escrow service. At the beginning of the transaction, the buyer makes a security deposit to the escrow service. This is done by the buyer sending a transaction to an address on which the escrow smartcontract runs. After the transaction, if both seller and buyer agree, the escrow smart contract will make the payment to the seller. If there is a
dispute, meaning either seller or buyer disagrees, the smart contract will withhold the payment from sending to the seller.

Escrow in simple words:
1.	Seller and Buyer both accept the transaction, the seller gets paid.
2.	Seller and Buyer cancel the transaction, the buyer gets refunded.
3.	If the seller accepts the transaction and the buyer does not. Funds will be sent to buyer after 30 days (contract period you can keep it 2 minutes for testing/lab purpose). The seller can try to convince the buyer by then.
4.	If the buyer accepts but seller does not, funds will remain in the contract until it is killed by escrow creator. Once killed, funds will be sent to the buyer immediately.

## Contract Design

Create at least 3 accounts (one for Bank to collect the deposited amount and other two for seller and buyer) and mine few ethers, before you deploy the contract. Buyer, Seller and Escrow/Bank addresses can be hard-coded and  let's assume settlement call must be made by Escrow for lab purpose.

Variable list and functions mentioned below are just for reference. You can design the solution for this lab provided all the functionalities are covered.



### Variables

1.	Buyer, seller and bank/escrow address
2.	Boolean variables to keep track of buyer and seller agreement and if both have given their choice (agree/disagree) or not.
3.	Start variable to keep track when contract starts.

## Lab Tasks
### Lab Task 1: Both parties agrees

You should have a Deposit function to increment the balance - Buyer to deposits product price, contract time starts now. This is common for all lab tasks in this lab.
If both the parties agree, transfer 1% of the deposit amount to escrow (transaction fee) and rest to seller.

### Lab Task 2: Both parties disagree

If both disagrees, take transaction fee (1% of teh deposit amount) and refund buyer.

### Lab Task 3: In case of dispute, one of them agree other don't.

If seller agrees but not buyer, take transaction fee and contract should wait for 2 minutes and refund buyer (remember to call this function after 2 minutes). 
If buyer agree and seller don't, escrow will call the kill function and buyer gets refunded


Make sure your contract works for multiple calls and settlement happens only if both parties have explicitly given their approval/disapproval.
